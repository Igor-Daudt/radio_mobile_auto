<h1> Radio Mobile auto connect Antenna</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2> 
<p>Automating the process of checking the quantity of signal loss between a given location and the closest antennas using the radio mobile program</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span> the coordinates of a location where the link with close antennas will be simulated</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> The program prompts the user to enter a minimum distance for an antenna. This makes the task of finding an antenna more challenging, testing the limits of the program and signal transmissions</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> The height of the building that will be simulated is also an important factor for calculating the signal loss in a link with an antenna</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span> Word document with some details about the antenna that meets all the specifications</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> The .map, .net, and .dat files generated by the Radio Mobile software</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> All the outputs should be located inside in the folder C:\\RADIOMOBILE</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Some info</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span> The height of the antenna is stipulated, 27-33 meters</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>The excel file antennas.xlsx contains a list with all the antennas in RS-Brazil</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>The Excel file 'datasheets.xlsx' contains a list with all the possible transmitter/receivers used in this project in a standardized format</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>The pyautogui.findOnScreen methods vary with the size of the monitor screen where the program is running. I know using pyautogui is not professional at all, but for this project, at the time that I made it, I didn't see a way around it. The screen size of 1920x1080 was used in in all tests </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>I am aware that all the images should be placed in an 'images' folder</span>
  </li>
</ul>
